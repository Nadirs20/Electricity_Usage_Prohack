Integrated Telecom Analytics and Electricity OptimizationThis repository contains a multi-disciplinary data project that combines Business Intelligence (Tableau) with Predictive Modeling and Optimization (Python). The project is designed to monitor telecom network health while optimizing operational resources like electricity usage.Project Components1. Electricity Usage Optimization (Machine Learning)The Python component (found in Electricity_Usage_Prohack.ipynb) focuses on predictive analytics to enhance energy efficiency.Objective: Forecast electricity consumption and optimize usage based on resource constraints.Methodology:Data cleaning and feature engineering of time-series energy data.Implementation of regression models to generate predictions (pred).Application of optimization logic to derive efficient usage values (opt_pred).Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.2. Telecom Performance Analysis (Tableau)Interactive dashboards created to monitor the technical KPIs of a telecommunications network.Key Focus: Call Success Rates, Drop Call Rates, and Network Congestion.Goal: Identifying technical gaps in specific regions to improve Quality of Service (QoS).3. Voice and Revenue Insights (Tableau)Strategic dashboards designed for financial and marketing stakeholders.Key Focus: Revenue trends, ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), and Voice usage patterns.Goal: Identifying high-value customers and revenue-driving regions to maximize ROI.Key Insights and ResultsOptimization: The Prohack model narrows the gap between predicted and actual consumption, providing an optimized resource allocation strategy.Business Intelligence: Tableau dashboards enable 360-degree monitoring, allowing users to drill down from a country-wide view to specific regional performance metrics.Installation and UsagePython EnvironmentTo run the notebook and reproduce the results in Electricity_Usage_Prohack.csv:Bashpip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
